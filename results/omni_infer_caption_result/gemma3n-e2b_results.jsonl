He's speaking directly to the camera, expressing frustration about having spent a lot of money on his graphics card and power supply, but lacking a case to house the components. He jokingly admits to having all the parts but no place to put them, which leads to him suggesting using a cardboard box as a makeshift case. Throughout his monologue, he frequently gestures with his hands, particularly using his fingers to emphasize his points.
